description: How to author plan/documentation files for a directory served by Plandeck. Use whenever writing or editing .md/.mdx docs that a human will browse through Plandeck — choosing Markdown vs MDX, using the custom MDX blocks (Callout, CodeTabs, Decision, HtmlBlock), Mermaid diagrams, and keeping the folder discoverable and live-reload friendly. This is for AUTHORING agents that write docs INTO a Plandeck-served folder, not for contributing to Plandeck's own source.

# Authoring docs for Plandeck

Plandeck renders a directory of docs as a searchable, live-reloading,
**read-only** site. You (the agent) write the files; a human reads them in the
browser. Optimize for *human reading*, not for re-parsing your own output.

## File format: Markdown vs MDX

- Use **`.md`** for plain prose. No JSX runs in `.md` (safe by design).
- Use **`.mdx`** only when you need the custom blocks below. MDX executes the
  registered components — nothing else.

## Custom MDX blocks (`.mdx` only)

| Block | Props | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `<Callout>` | `type` = `info`/`warn`/`success`/`danger`, `title` | Highlighted note |
| `<CodeTabs>` | children: fenced-code blocks with `tab="..."` meta (optional `default`) | Tabbed code snippets |
| `<Decision>` | `title`, `status` = `proposed`/`accepted`/`rejected` | Architecture decision record |
| `<HtmlBlock>` | wraps one ```html fence | Sandboxed HTML preview (`sandbox=""`, scripts disabled) |

Example:

```mdx
<Callout type="warn" title="Heads up">
  This migration is irreversible. Take a backup first.
</Callout>

<Decision title="Use SQLite FTS5 for search" status="accepted">
  In-memory, zero external services, good enough for local doc sets.
</Decision>
```

Record real architecture choices as `<Decision>` blocks so the human gets an
ADR trail, not buried prose.

## Code blocks

Fenced code blocks (both `.md` and `.mdx`) render as a syntax-highlighted box
with a border, in light and dark themes. Set the language after the opening
fence for highlighting (e.g. ` ```ts `). **Line numbers are ON by default.**

Optional metadata after the language controls the header and gutter:

| Meta | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `title="server.ts"` | Shows a filename/header bar above the block | none |
| `showLineNumbers=false` | Hides the line-number gutter | line numbers on |
| `startLine=42` | First line number (useful for excerpts) | `1` |

Examples (the meta goes on the info string, after the language):

````md
```ts title="src/server.ts"
import { serve } from "bun";
serve({ port: 3000 });
```

```sql showLineNumbers=false
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 3;
```

```go title="sync.go" startLine=42
func FindVerifiedOrders() ([]Order, error) { ... }
```
````

Notes:
- Prefer `title="..."` when the snippet is a real file — the header gives the
  reader instant context.
- Use `startLine=N` when you paste an excerpt from deep in a file so the numbers
  match the source.
- Inline `<code>…</code>` and inline code spans stay literal (underscores,
  asterisks, backticks inside them are NOT parsed as Markdown), so
  `<code>product_id</code>` renders as-is.

## Mermaid diagrams

Fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks render as diagrams (centered) in both `.md` and
`.mdx`. Prefer a diagram over a long textual description of a flow or
architecture.

## Tables

GFM tables (`| col | col |`) render with borders and a header row in both `.md`
and `.mdx`. Use them for structured comparisons instead of nested bullet lists.

## Folder & discovery rules

- Plandeck respects **`.gitignore`** and skips hidden files/dirs by default.
  Don't write plan docs into ignored or dotted paths — they won't appear.
- Files above the size cap (**5 MB** default) are skipped. Split huge docs.
- **HTML and SVG are served as inert downloads, never live** — don't rely on
  active `.html`/`.svg` content; use `<HtmlBlock>` for sandboxed previews.
- Use clear file/folder names; the sidebar and full-text search key off them.

## Read-only mindset

There is no database and no write-back. The filesystem is the source of truth:
to change what the human sees, write the file. Live reload pushes your edits to
the open page automatically — no restart needed.
